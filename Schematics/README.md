# Notes
I'm using Arduino Mega in the schematics, as it was the only Arduino available
in TinyCAD. I used Arduino Nano in final project. It shouldn't matter anyway, as 
the pins used work the same way on Mega, Uno and Nano. In case something does go 
wrong, you can always customize the charlieplexing.ino file.<br>
Check out TinyCAD [here.](https://www.tinycad.net/) <br>
I used [this](http://www.multiwingspan.co.uk/arduino.php?page=charlie) guide to 
charlieplexing while designing the circuit.
