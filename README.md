# Project P.E.D.R.O.
Pedro (Personal Emotional Display of Robust Obstruction) is an arduino based
LED mask.
## Versions
Due to time constrains, I won't be able to finish the original plan of making
a Watch_Dogs 2 Wrench-style LED matrix, since I don't know anything about electronics
and the event I want to attend with it is this September. <br>
That means that the first version of this mask is gonna be much simpler, with two
LED strips using charlieplexing arranged in circles.<br>
I still want to make rev 2 with fully animated LED matrix display, but that will
have to wait for later™️.
## Bill of materials for rev 1 (so far)
- 24*LED, ⌀ 3mm
- 4*330 Ohm resistors
- 1*1K Ohm resistor
- Arduino Nano
- 4 buttons; leftover mechanical keyboard switchies are used in my case
- some wire
- Paintball/airsoft style mask (Used a cheap Aliexpress one, I'll post link once it arrives)
- 3D printer for all the enclousures and stuff
## Rev 1 plans
- Arduino Nano in enclousure with buttons mounted on a belt
- Power from a power bank in a pocket / bag
- 4 wires bunched together using a cable sleeve running from Arduino on the belt to LEDS in the mask
## To do
