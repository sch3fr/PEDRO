# Project P.E.D.R.O.
Pedro (Personal Emotional Display of Robust Obstruction) is an arduino based
led mask.
## Versions
Due to time constrains, I won't be able to finish the original plan of making
a Watch_Dogs 2 Wrench-style LED matrix, since I don't know anything about electronics
and the event I want to attend with it is this September. <br>
That means that the first version of this mask is gonna be much simpler, with two
LED strips using charlieplexing arranged in circles.<br>
I still want to make rev 2 with fully animated LED matrix display, but that will
have to wait for later™️.
## Bill of materials for rev 1 (so far)
- 24 LEDs
- some wire
- Arduino (Would love to use Nano, but not sure if there are enough pins yet)
- Paintball/airsoft style mask (Used a cheap Aliexpress one, I'll post link once it arrives)
- 4 or 6 buttons, not sure yet
- 3D printer for all the enclousures and stuff
## To do
- [ ] Design circuit
- [ ] Write software
- [ ] Design parts for 3D printing
- [ ] Print it
- [ ] Wire it
- [ ] Build it
